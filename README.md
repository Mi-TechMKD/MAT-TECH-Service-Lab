MAT-TECH ServiceLab is a local AI-powered assistant for technicians, running entirely on a private offline server (localhost). It analyzes device symptoms, suggests possible faults, and provides organized visual repair guides (photos and videos). The system speeds up diagnostics, reduces errors, and maintains a centralized knowledge base — all while keeping data fully local and secure. Ideal for service centers that need efficiency without compromising privacy.
