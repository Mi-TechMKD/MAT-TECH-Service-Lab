MAT-TECH ServiceLab is a local AI-powered assistant for technicians, running entirely on a private offline server (localhost) with no internet connection required. The system collects and analyzes device symptoms, identifies potential faults, and provides clear, structured repair instructions with support for images and videos.

With MAT-TECH ServiceLab, service centers can significantly speed up diagnostics, reduce the risk of human error, and maintain a centralized knowledge base for all devices and procedures. Because all data remains local on the server, privacy and security are fully protected.

This tool is ideal for service centers seeking efficiency and precision in their operations without compromising data security.
